World in Two and a Half Days

In the intoxicated afternoon,
Two extra drinks, perhaps one too soon.
Sleepless deep into the night,
Under a sky so overcast, so trite.

Eleven equidistant segments on a single line,
Shades of gray, each one so fine.
A balance of black and white,
Japanese songs, beyond my insight.

Joyous tunes burst from the Xiami player's core,
Nepal's strong quake, a tremor hard to ignore.
Wang Guozhen's departure, a poet's last song,
Half-asleep, half-awake, where do I belong?

Between waking and dreaming, the line's so thin,
Images of two and a half days, fleeting, akin.
Scattered on the brain's horizontal timeline, vast,
Deep and extending, with a carefree contrast.

With a touch of nonchalance, and half a cup of pretense,
To all of it, I say, "Bottoms up!" in past tense.
