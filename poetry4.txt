live alone

In the stillness of the deep night,
It seems I see a journey outside the window's light.
The TV plays something that feels related to me,
Yet it's a distant scene, somewhere I can't see.

The moment a kite's string breaks free,
It's not as painful as I imagined it to be.
When the music stops, in that brief lull,
It becomes an epiphany, as the keyboard keys fall.

In a one-room apartment,
Always lived in by just one occupant.
Sweat and tears flow,
Yet I can care for myself, this I know.

The mailbox is crammed with letters, so dense,
Yet I don't await that one response, that recompense.
Friends tell me not to cry,
Acting as if nothing's amiss has become my lullaby.
