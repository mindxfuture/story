Standing in the heart of an unfamiliar city,
The wind, so fresh and breezy.
In my notebook, songs unknown I jot,
Three windows open in winter, whether cold or hot.

Intermittent noises from the streets near,
Words, alas, can't be food, my dear.
Angel's spell, so mystically enchanting,
Reminds me of perfume packaging, so entrancing.

Violets written on black paper in white,
In unfamiliar places, everything's out of sight.
Including directions, where to start,
Including dreams, close to the heart.
