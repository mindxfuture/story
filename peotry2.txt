Labyrinth

From carnality to the soul's essence,
From desire, a journey to resurgence.

Awakened in the midnight's haze,
Realizing the world's mysterious maze.

Books at hand,
Words in the palm's span,
Songs by the ear,
A heart that struggles with fear.

That dim light glowing in the night,
That scene of tears and laughter at dawn's first light.

Reaching the end, yet no end in sight,
Seeking the endpoint, it becomes the starting rite.
